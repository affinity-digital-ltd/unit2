# {Pro}Coders Unit 2

This Unit will take roughly 240 hours to complete.

Throughout this Unit there will be a great emphasis on JavaScript, where you will learn to build a Server Side Rendered React app which will replace the frontend of the Rails app.  You will then refactor the Rails app to be an API only (barring the admin panel).   This will then be accessed from the React frontend app.  

## Prerequisits
- [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) is a style guide and library for JavaScript, similar to the style guide we used for Ruby in the previous unit.  If you follow the instructions on that website to add functionality to your IDE then it will automatically lint your JS files and help you fix any errors you may have.
- Set your editor to use 2 spaces for `.js` files.  How to do this will depend on the IDE that you use.
